                I started my development journey by building small UI
                experiments and quickly realized that thoughtful interfaces can
                remove friction in people&apos;s everyday lives. Over several
                years in frontend engineering, I have focused on creating
                products that feel intuitive, readable, and genuinely usable for
                everyone.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph margin="none">
                Today, I work as Lead Developer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise
                with a strong focus on accessibility, component architecture,
                and maintainable design systems. Across 7 years of frontend and
                UI/UX development, I have partnered with teams to ship React
                experiences that are performant, inclusive, and grounded in user
                needs.

          Accessibility matters to me because technology should expand
          opportunity, not create barriers. My mission is to build digital
          experiences where people can participate fully, regardless of ability,
          device, or context.

        <Paragraph margin={{ top: "small", bottom: "none" }}>
          I take a user-centered and inclusive approach to development by
          combining semantic engineering practices, clear interaction patterns,
          and iterative testing. What drives my work is seeing people succeed
          because the interface supports them instead of getting in their way.
